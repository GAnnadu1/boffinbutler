        Cookie Policy
        </div>
        <p>Cookies are small blocks of data created by a web server while a user is browsing a website and placed on the user's computer or other device by the user's web browser. Cookies enable web servers to store stateful information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) on the user's device or to track the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to save for subsequent use information that the user previously entered into form fields, such as names, addresses, passwords, and payment card numbers. Authentication cookies are commonly used by web servers to authenticate that a user is logged in, and with which account they are logged in. Without the cookie, users would need to authenticate themselves by logging in on each page containing sensitive information that they wish to access (Source: <Link href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie' className="text-blue-600 underline">Wikipedia</Link>).</p>
        <p>Cookies help analyze web traffic and enable web applications to respond to You as an individual by tailoring its services to Your needs, likes & dislikes by collecting and remembering information about Your preferences.</p>
        <p>Cookies help us provide You a better website experience. A cookie does not give us access to Your computer or any other information about You except what You choose to share with us.
